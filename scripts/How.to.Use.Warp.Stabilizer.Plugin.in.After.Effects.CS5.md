## What is Warp Stabilizer?
 
Warp Stabilizer is a plugin that analyzes your footage and automatically applies stabilization and motion correction. It can also remove rolling shutter artifacts and create seamless transitions between shots. Warp Stabilizer works by finding features in your footage that it can track and use as reference points. It then warps the pixels around those points to create a smooth and stable result.

## Tips and Tricks for Using Warp Stabilizer
 
Here are some tips and tricks for using Warp Stabilizer effectively:

- If your footage has a lot of motion blur or low contrast, you may need to increase the number of track points or use manual tracking to get a better result.
- If your footage has moving objects or people in the foreground, you may need to mask them out or use the Delete Track Points feature to avoid unwanted warping.
- If your footage has parallax or perspective changes, you may need to use Subspace Warp or Perspective methods to preserve the depth and realism of your scene.
- If your footage has rolling shutter artifacts or jello effect, you may need to enable Rolling Shutter Repair or Enhanced Reduction options to fix them.
- If your footage has gaps or black borders after stabilization, you may need to use Synthesize Edges or Auto-scale options to fill them in.
