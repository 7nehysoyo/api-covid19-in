The configure.csv and configure\_mp.csv files are part of the game's configuration settings that determine how the game runs on your system. They are located in the main folder of the game's installation directory, usually C:\Program Files\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare\main. Sometimes, these files can get corrupted, missing, or overwritten by other programs, causing the error to appear.
  
One way to fix this error is to replace the damaged files with working ones. You can download the config.cfg and config\_mp.cfg files from here:
  
- Config.cfg: http://snk.to/f-ctniycpz
- Config\_mp.cfg: http://snk.to/f-cduja1hr

Alternatively, you can create your own config.cfg and config\_mp.cfg files by opening two new Notepad documents and copying and pasting the following text into each one:
